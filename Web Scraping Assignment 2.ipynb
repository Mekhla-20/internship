      "\n",
      "The final thing I wanna say is if you are on a budget of 60-70 go for the iPhone 11 and If you have enough money go for the iPhone 11 Pro Max don’t buy the iPhone 11 Pro (My opinion)\n",
      "Or you can get iPhone 11 and Apple Watch series 5 with same price of 11 pro \n",
      "The phone is great you will not regret after buying it go for it ??\n",
      "This is my first iOS phone. I am very happy with this product. Very much satisfied with this. I love this phone.\n",
      "Amazing Powerful and Durable Gadget.\n",

      "iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.\n",
      "If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.\n",
      "Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !\n",
      "It’s a must buy who is looking for an upgrade from previous generation of iPhones. If you are using XR then still you can hold on for sometime and upgrade to 2020 model else this phone is a must buy . Camera quality is amazing and wide angle is something to count upon. Performance wise it’s amazing and feels premium while holding in hand. So a big YES for this device. Go for 128 GB variant as the 4K videos will occupy lots of space and the storage can get over very quickly. Try to buy it within some offer to get the best value for money.\n",
      "It's my first time to use iOS phone and I am loving my upgradation 😍😍 I love the color, I love the assebility of the phone....I need to learn more about its functionality, but as far as I have seen, it's quite easy and it has a lot of functions to work on, specially if you are a content writer or a blogger you get a lot of content creation platforms and they are really amazing. \n",

      "Really worth of money. i just love it. It is the best phone ever.\n",
      "Best budget Iphone till date ❤️ go for it guys without second thought. Let me explain you guys about Camera, Display, battery, and performance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Camera: at this price range there is no comparison of camera, you’ll love the picture quality as well as video quality. I am a Vlogger I wanted an iPhone with 4k video by front camera and I got this phone and I am more than happy 😃 \n",
      "\n",
      "Battery: I use this phone roughly as I am active social media person and I have a youtube channel. so the battery backup of this phone is far far better than Iphone x and I charge this phone once in a day despite of using this roughly.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Display: don’t go on negative reviews about display. Earlier, I was using Iphone X since 1 n half years. I didn’t see any major difference in display. The display quality is superb as it’s Apple device. You can compare one plus amoled display with Iphone 11 display you’ll get to know that Iphone 11 display is much better. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance: the performance of this phone as same as Iphone 11 pro, there is 3 difference between Iphone 11 pro and Iphone 11. First is display, second you’ll get ultra wide angle camera in iphone 11 pro, and third is display Resolution. Except these things there is no difference and performance remains the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you’ll hold this phone you’ll feel that you are holding a premium device ❤️ \n",
      "\n",
      "Like if my review helps.\n",
      "Excellent camera, good performance, no lag. The lcd display is also good.. but difference come when we watch movie in prime and Netflix, the colours are not vibrant.. as we see in amoled display.. and the charger in box is of 5 watts.. takes more than 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100.. so guys be prepare to buy 18 watts charger . Finally I am an android user, it was my first Iapple phone, I promise u guys the iOS is so smooth.. overall the phone is damn good.... close eyes to buy it.. thanks to Flipkart to deliver this amazing genuine product on time.. at last the iPhone 11 make me smile\n",
      "Totally in love with this ❤ the camera quality is amazing just love it 😘😘😘 itsss dammnnnnnn amazing...  Must buy iPhone 11 this is my best experience ever ☀👌👌🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡 thanku apple ❤\n",
      "This is my first ever I phone. Before this I was using my google nexus 5. But moving from android to iOS is a great experience. It’s worth at this price. I will highly recommend it if you want to move to iOS. The best part of this phone is it’s camera and it’s battery life. This two things have won my heart. I loved it. Happy to have it in my hand. Still exploring its features. And can’t forget to mention Flipkart service. Very prompt service and fast delivery.\n",
      "It’s been almost a month since I have been using this phone. I upgraded from an iPhone 8. The main issue with my 8 was battery and this phone is just awesome when it comes to battery. It lasts a day and a half for me with my regular use , internet connected always with 4g \n",
      "Can’t move forward without saying this. Battery of this phone is a life saver when I am traveling or at work when I don’t get the option to charge \n",
      "Camera is superb. Front cam selfies and back cam photos are just awesome. \n",
      "Since i came from the smaller phone category which was an iPhone 8 , I found it difficult to adjust first with the size of this phone, but after the days of usage, I got very much used to it. \n",
      "Watching a video or reading online is awesome with this bigger screen. \n",
      "I am very much happy with this upgrade \n",
      "I am adding few photos I have clicked. Night photography is awesome \n",

      "\n",
      "The phone is great and does excellent RAM management like any other Apple device. \n",
      "\n",
      "The screen, though a LCD and lesser ppi as compared to other flagship phones of competitor brands, is a delight to watch with perfect refresh rate. \n",
      "\n",
      "The phone has a great battery life, even more than the iPhone Xr . With ios 14.4.2, its a brilliant and super fast device.  Even the camera is a decent upgrade in addition to the A13 Bionic (7nm+) chipset makes it extremely efficient device. \n",
      "\n",
      "The battery easily takes you through the day and charges reasonably fast. No 15 W charger or charging cord. You have to buy one.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Unless you have a fancy of buying the latest iPhone 12, iPhone 11 is a perfect value for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flipkart service is as usual great and dependable\n",
      "\n",
      "Go for it!\n",
      "I have migrated from OP 7pro... and trust me, iPhone 11 is totally worth it.. following are the reasons:-\n",
      "1)there is ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUE WITH THE DISPLAY... its crisp, sharp and I found it to be much much better than OP7 pro. Netflix, Prime video all run crisply... you won’t miss a thing. True Tone works flawlessly...the display brightness is perfect. OP have not calibrated their screens properly.  \n",
      "2) iPhone 11 series have really good cameras... others have spoken in depth about them.\n",
      "3) battery back up is fabulous\n",
      "4) Screen is FLAT... Hence no accidental touches\n",
      "5) ABUNDANCE OF ACCESSORY products like TEMPERED SCREEN PROTECTORS, back covers. Best is Spigen.\n",

      "It’s an amazing product from apple and the camera is simply superb. Phone is faster.Night shot is simply superb and detailing and colour differentiation from camera is an added advantage\n",
      "\n",
      "This review I have written from iPhone 11 only and I am glad to say outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons wise if we see HD+ display only, no battery percentage indicator as in older iPhone 8. \n",
      "No assistive touch control button in it\n",
      "No oleophobic coating on back panel glass and finger prints are visible but since I bought mint green colour I felt lucky as it won’t be visible.\n",
